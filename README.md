# jQuery Learning Projects

Welcome to my jQuery learning repository! üëã

This repo contains my hands-on practice and mini-projects as I learn and explore the fundamentals of **jQuery** ‚Äî a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. These examples are designed to reinforce DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, and Ajax interactions using jQuery in real-world scenarios.
